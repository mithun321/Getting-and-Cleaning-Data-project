CodeBook for the project
========================

It describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

First data: tidydata.txt/tidydata.csv
-------------------------------------

In the final tidydata.txt (check tidydata.csv for cleaner look, .txt is created as coursera platform does not allow to upload .csv file) file, there are 68 columns. To produce this data set I have considered only those variables ended with mean() or std() (not meanFreq()) and also added y and subject variable. 


Second data: group_average.txt/group_average.csv
------------------------------------------------

In the second tidy data, named as group_average.txt (check  group_average.csv for cleaner look) there are 4 variables. subject, activity, variable.name and Average which is the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
