CodeBook for the project
========================

It describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

First data: tidydata.txt/tidydata.csv
-------------------------------------

In the final tidydata.txt (check tidydata.csv for cleaner look, .txt is created as coursera platform does not allow to upload .csv file) file, there are 68 columns. To produce this data set I have considered only those variables ended with mean() or std() (not meanFreq()) and also added y (activity) and subject variable. 

Column names are given below:

* subject
* tBodyAcc-mean()-X
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
* tBodyAcc-std()-X
* tBodyAcc-std()-Y
* tBodyAcc-std()-Z
* tGravityAcc-mean()-X
* tGravityAcc-mean()-Y
* tGravityAcc-mean()-Z
* tGravityAcc-std()-X
* tGravityAcc-std()-Y
* tGravityAcc-std()-Z
* tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X
* tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y
* tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z

Description of above variables taken from features_info.txt files:

Feature Selection 
------------------

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of estimated variables that are present in the tidydata.txt/tidydata.csv data set: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


Second data: group_average.txt/group_average.csv
------------------------------------------------

In the second tidy data, named as group_average.txt (check  group_average.csv for cleaner look) there are 4 variables. subject, activity, variable.name and Average which is the average of each variable (variables are listed in the above table) for each activity and each subject.  

Column names are given below:

* subject
* activity
* Average
* variable.name

N.B.: For the optional data (combined.txt/combined.csv), there are some extra variables not present in tidydata.txt. Please check features_info.txt for more information about the input variables.
